    - "For the past year we\u2019ve been on this submarine together, I have been
      doing pretty much whatever you asked, whenever you asked."
    - Each and every time I did what you told me to do, I came back to the control
      room to scorn and criticism, either out loud or screaming in your silence.
    - Each day I went out and revised my routine, becoming more efficient and better,
      in hopes that one day I would be worthy of you.
    - "Well, I may be a little late to discover this, but I don\u2019t think I am
      unworthy of love at all!  "
